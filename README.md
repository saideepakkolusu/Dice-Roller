## 🖥️ Demo

```bash
How many dice do you want to roll? (or type 'exit' to quit): 3
You rolled: (4, 2, 6)
Roll again with the same number of dice? (yes/no OR y/n or exit): y
You rolled: (1, 5, 3)
Roll again with the same number of dice? (yes/no OR y/n or exit): no
Thanks for playing!

🧠 How It Works
The program takes user input for the number of dice to roll.

It validates the input to ensure it's a positive integer.

Dice results are randomly generated using random.randint(1, 6).

After each roll, the user can choose to roll again or exit.
